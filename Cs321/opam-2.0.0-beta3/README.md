# opam - A package manager for OCaml

[![TravisCI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ocaml/opam.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ocaml/opam)
[![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/ocaml/opam?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/AltGr/opam)

Opam is a source-based package manager for OCaml. It supports multiple simultaneous
compiler installations, flexible package constraints, and a Git-friendly development
workflow.

Opam was created and is maintained by [OCamlPro](http://www.ocamlpro.com).

To get started, checkout the [Install](http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html)
and [Usage](http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Usage.html) guides.

## Compiling this repo

* Make sure you have OCaml and GNU make installed. If you don't have a recent
  enough version of OCaml (>= 4.01.0) at hand, see the next section.
* Run `./configure`
* Run `make lib-ext` as advertised by `./configure` if you don't have the
  dependencies installed. This will locally take care of all OCaml dependencies
  for you (downloading them, unless you used the inclusive archive we provide
  for each release).
* Run `make`
* Run `make install`

This is all you need for installing and using opam, but if you want to use the
`opam-lib` (to work on opam-related tools), you need to link it to installed
libraries, rather than use `make lib-ext` which would cause conflicts. It's
easier to already have a working opam installation in this case, so you can do
it as a second step.

* Make sure to have ocamlfind, ocamlgraph, cmdliner >= 0.9.8, jsonm, cudf,
  dose3, re >= 1.2.0, opam-file-format installed. Or run `opam install
  opam-lib --deps-only` if you already have a working instance. Re-run
  `./configure` once done
* Run `make libinstall` at the end

## Compiling without OCaml

`make cold` is provided as a facility to compile OCaml, then bootstrap opam.
You don't need need to run `./configure` in that case, but
you may specify `CONFIGURE_ARGS` if needed, e.g.:

```
make cold CONFIGURE_ARGS="--prefix ~/local"
```

NOTE: You'll still need GNU make.
